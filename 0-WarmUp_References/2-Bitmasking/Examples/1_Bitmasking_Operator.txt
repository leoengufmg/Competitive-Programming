Why to use?
	because is fast.
	everything is stored in form of bits

a >> b faster than (a / (2^b) )

& AND
| OR
~ NOT
<< LEFT SHIFT
>> RIGHT SHIFT
^ XOR

AND
A B A&B
0 0 0
0 1 0
1 0 0
1 1 1

OR
A B A|B
0 0 0
0 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1

XOR
A B A^B
0 0 0
0 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 0

multiply by 2
5 << 1 = 10
5 << 2 = 20
5 << n = 5 * 2^n

divide by 2
5 >> 1 = 2
5 >> 2 = 1
5 >> n = 5 / (2^n)
